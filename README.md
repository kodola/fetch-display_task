## General info
Information about companies have been downloaded and displayed in the form of a table. 
Company names, identifiers and cities were taken from one external source. In addition, revenue data was downloaded for each company.
The total income, average income and last recorded income were determined for each company in the table. It was created an input that filters the table depending on the company name. The table contains pagination. The company names in the table are clickable. 
By clicking on a particular name we can move to the information about the specific company. The table is displayed responsively.
